#codeforces

Codeforces on node expect the `this` variable to have a print function and a readline function.
This folder aims to help test scripts for codeforces.
Run `node codeforces name` and it will run the `main.js` script in the `name` folder, for every file in `name/inputs` and compare it with the files with the same name in `name/outputs`
